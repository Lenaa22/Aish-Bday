    <h4>Happy 19th birthday to my absolute everything 🫶🏽 I Can't believe you're finally 19 now 🤭. I’ve been waiting for this for SO LONG OMGGG 😭. We’ve been best friends since high school and even before that we were friends in elementary and middle school. All this time you’ve been my only constant friend who I can't imagine living life without. Our journey together has been amazing so far, and I cant wait for the other memories like montreal (that was hella fun 😜) that we’ll make in the near future.
